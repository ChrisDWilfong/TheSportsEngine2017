                <p>After the game Ada head coach Craig McBroom said he was sure his team had just won the school's 11th championship.  In the other dressing room, Owasso coach Gary Harper was sure his Rams had lost.  If Ada had known the rule, they may not have ran the ball to the sideline and not attempting to score on fourth down on the Ada 17 giving the ball back to Ada with 24 seconds.</p>
                <p>Owasso did not learn of their winning of the championship until the team was in their locker room back in Owasso and head coach Gary Harper received a phone call.  A celebration broke out!</p>
